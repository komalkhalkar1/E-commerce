            <h2> Mint green dial </h2>
            <p>
                A watchmaking technique
                The sunray finish creates delicate light reflections on many dials in the Oyster Perpetual collection.
                It is obtained using masterful brushing techniques that create grooves running outwards from the centre
                of the dial.

                Light is diffused consistently along each engraving, creating a characteristic subtle glow that moves
                depending on the position of the wrist. Once the sunray finish has been completed, the dial colour is
                applied using Physical Vapour Deposition or electroplating. A light coat of varnish gives the dial its
                final look.

            <h2>Supple and comfortable</h2>
            <p>
                The design, development and production of Rolex bracelets and clasps, as well as the stringent tests
                they face, involve advanced high technology.

                And, as with all the components of the watch, aesthetic controls by the human eye guarantee impeccable
                beauty. The Jubilee, a supple and comfortable five-piece link metal bracelet, was designed and made
                especially for the launch of the Oyster Perpetual Datejust in 1945..
